# Answering-Business-Questions-using-SQL

In this project, we're going to use SQL skills to answer business questions. We'll be working with a modified version of a database called Chinook. The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - kind of like a mini-iTunes store.

The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. This information is contained in eleven tables. A schema diagram will help us understand the available columns and the structure of the data. A schema diagram is also uploaded here for the Chinook database.
